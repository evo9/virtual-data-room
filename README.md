# Data Room

A virtual data room for due diligence: nested folders, PDF upload and viewing, and read-only sharing (public link or per-email) with revocation.

**Live:**
- Web: https://virtual-data-room-two.vercel.app
- API: https://virtual-data-room-production-8114.up.railway.app (liveness: `/health`)

## Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | `owner@demo.test` | `UzDVbBRSuMCYGESB` | 
| Viewer (share recipient) | `viewer@demo.test` | `KbdhvDnzXD50qJlj` |

The owner account has a data room with nested folders, a few PDFs, and shares already handed out. The viewer account has a shared room and a separately shared folder and file in "Shared with me" - both sides of sharing are visible without registering. Feel free to register your own account instead if you'd rather see the empty-state flow, or if someone before you has rearranged the demo content.

These passwords are one-time, used only for this demo, and not reused anywhere else.

There's no seed script - a `File` row is meaningless without a matching object in the storage bucket, so seeding would need the same upload machinery the app already has. The demo accounts and their content were created once, by hand, through the deployed UI - which doubles as the final end-to-end walkthrough (register → folders → upload → rename → move → share → revoke → delete) before shipping.

## Stack

- **Web** - React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query. Deployed on Vercel.
- **API** - NestJS 11, Prisma, PostgreSQL. Deployed on Railway.
- **File storage** - Supabase Storage, private bucket, signed URLs only (the API never proxies file bytes).
- **Auth** - email/password, JWT.
- Two independent `package.json` (`apps/web`, `apps/api`), no monorepo tooling - deliberate, the project is small enough that a build orchestrator would be pure overhead.

## Running locally

Requirements: Node 20.19+ (or 22.12+), a PostgreSQL database (this project targets Supabase's Postgres, including its connection pooler), a Supabase Storage bucket.

### API (`apps/api`)

```bash
cd apps/api
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the values below
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev
```

Env vars (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase's **transaction pooler** (port 6543). Must include `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1` - without it, Prisma's prepared statements collide on a pooled connection and queries intermittently fail with `prepared statement "s0" already exists`. |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Supabase's **direct/session** connection (port 5432), used only by `prisma migrate`. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / `SUPABASE_BUCKET` | Storage bucket the API issues signed upload/view/download URLs against. The bucket must allow `PUT` and the `apikey`/`x-upsert` headers in its CORS config, or uploads fail silently in the browser. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs the single access token (7-day expiry, no refresh - see "Cut from MVP" below). |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated allowed origins for the web app. Defaults to allow-all if unset - fine locally, set it explicitly in production. |
| `PORT` | Defaults to `3000`. |

`npm install` also generates the Prisma client (via `@prisma/client`'s own postinstall hook) - no separate `prisma generate` step needed. `npm run build && npm run lint && npm test` before pushing.

### Web (`apps/web`)

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the values below
npm run dev
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL of the API (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` locally). |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Sent as the `apikey` header when the browser uploads a file directly to the signed Supabase Storage URL the API hands back - the anon key is safe to ship to the client, it only authorizes the specific signed operation. |

`npm run build && npm run lint` before pushing.

## Project decisions

**Presigned uploads, not proxied bytes.** The API never touches file contents. It issues an upload intent (ownership + MIME type + size check) and a Supabase signed URL; the browser `PUT`s the file straight to storage and then calls back to confirm. This keeps the API stateless with respect to file size and avoids ever holding a multi-hundred-MB PDF in server memory. View/download URLs are short-lived (5 minutes) so revoking a share actually revokes access; the upload URL itself doesn't need that constraint, since it's only usable to write the one object it was issued for.

**Materialized path for the folder tree.** Every `Folder.path` stores the chain of ancestor folder ids as a slash-separated string ending in the folder's own id (a folder two levels deep has path `grandparentId/parentId/selfId/`) - the room id isn't part of it, that boundary is tracked separately. Subtree operations - delete-preview counts/size, share inheritance, breadcrumb trimming - are a single `path LIKE 'prefix%'` query with an index on `path`, not a recursive CTE. The trade-off is that moving a folder would need to rewrite `path` on its whole subtree; folder move isn't implemented (see below), so this hasn't been exercised in practice yet.

**`storageKey` is independent of the file name.** It's a UUID assigned at upload, never derived from or updated by the display name. Renaming a file is a single DB row update; the bucket object is untouched.

**Sharing is one polymorphic table.** `Share` has `resourceType` (`DATAROOM`/`FOLDER`/`FILE`) + `resourceId` with no foreign key - a share can point at any of the three resource types. `mode` picks public-link vs per-email; access resolution (`resolveAccess`) walks the target resource's own ancestor chain (built from the same materialized path) and checks whether any active share covers a node in that chain, which is how "share a folder" implies read access to everything nested inside it without a separate inheritance table.

**Email/password, not OAuth.** A reviewer opening this cold shouldn't need to configure an OAuth app or redirect URI just to log in. Simpler surface, one less deployed dependency.

**Deliberately cut from MVP:**
- **Refresh tokens.** A single 7-day JWT, no rotation or silent refresh. A leaked token is valid until it expires; there's no server-side revocation short of changing the secret. Acceptable for a demo, not for production.
- **Cleanup of abandoned uploads.** An upload intent creates a `File` row before the browser finishes `PUT`ing the bytes; if the tab closes mid-upload, that row (and, in rarer partial-write cases, a bucket object) never gets a `completeUpload` call and never gets garbage-collected. It's filtered out of every listing (`uploadedAt: null`), so it's invisible to users, but it lingers in the database and possibly the bucket.
- **Moving a folder.** Files can be moved between folders; folders themselves can be renamed and deleted, but not relocated into a different parent. The materialized-path design above supports it, but the mutation (rewriting `path` on a whole subtree, and re-checking name conflicts at the destination) wasn't built.
- **Search and versioning** - both explicitly optional in the assignment, not started; see "How it scales" below for the shape a search index would take.

        string resourceType "DATAROOM / FOLDER / FILE"
        uuid resourceId "polymorphic - no FK"
        string mode "PUBLIC_LINK / USER"
        string token UK "null unless PUBLIC_LINK"
        string granteeEmail "null unless USER"
        string role "VIEWER / EDITOR, only VIEWER used today"
        string createdById "who created the share, not an enforced FK"
        datetime revokedAt "null while active"
    }
```

`Share.resourceId` deliberately has no foreign key - it can reference `DataRoom`, `Folder`, or `File` depending on `resourceType`, and a share outlives the row it points at (a deleted resource leaves a dangling share, which read paths filter out rather than treat as an error). `Folder` and `File` both carry a nullable `folderId`/`parentId` - `null` means "lives at the room's root" rather than needing a separate root marker row.

## How it scales

**Aggregate size and item count for a folder, including its whole subtree.** Today: a raw SQL aggregate over `path LIKE 'prefix%'` (backing the delete-preview panel), using the index on `path` - one query, no recursion, regardless of tree depth. This is fine for an occasional pre-delete check but doesn't scale to showing "size" on every folder row in a listing, since each row would trigger its own subtree scan. The next step is denormalized counters (`size`, `itemCount`) stored directly on `Folder`, updated either transactionally inside each mutation (folder create/delete, file upload/delete/move) for immediate consistency at the cost of extra lock contention on deep trees, or asynchronously via a queue for cheaper writes at the cost of a brief staleness window. Either way the read path stays O(1) per folder instead of O(subtree size).

**100,000 files in one data room.** Already the operating assumption, not a hypothetical: every listing endpoint returns one folder level at a time (never the whole room flattened), paginated with keyset cursors over composite indexes - `(dataRoomId, parentId, nameLower, id)` for folders, `(dataRoomId, folderId, nameLower, id)` for files, `(resourceType, resourceId, createdAt, id)` / `(granteeEmail, createdAt, id)` for shares - so a page costs `O(page size)` regardless of how many siblings exist, and no listing endpoint runs `COUNT(*)` over the room (the delete-preview subtree aggregate is the one deliberate exception, and it's not on a list-rendering path). What's genuinely missing at that scale is name search across the whole room; the assignment lists it as optional, and the honest answer for when it's needed is a trigram index (`pg_trgm`) rather than `LIKE '%x%'`, since a B-tree on `nameLower` only accelerates prefix matches.

**Viewer/editor roles.** `Share.role` already exists in the schema (`VIEWER` / `EDITOR`); only `VIEWER` is exercised today because the assignment only asks for read access. Turning `EDITOR` into real permissions doesn't touch the model - it's a handful of call sites in the authorization layer, not a redesign: widen the `AccessLevel` union to include `EDITOR`, stop `resolveAccess` from collapsing every share to `VIEWER` regardless of `role`, and let the mutation endpoints that currently hardcode a required level of `OWNER` also accept `EDITOR` (while keeping share management owner-only). Growing further - a default role per room, or shares granted to a group rather than one email - would build on the same `Share` row shape, just with a different `granteeEmail` resolution step.

## Where AI was used

All code in this repository was written by an agent (Claude Code). I was responsible for the task breakdown, the architectural decisions, the API contracts, reviewing every diff with targeted point fixes - and for commits, database migrations, and production checks, all of which the project rules ban the agent from doing.

### How I organized the work

An orchestrator plus a fixed roster of subagents: backend-dev (`apps/api` only), frontend-dev (`apps/web` only), test-writer (targeted tests only for access control, name conflicts, and public tokens), reviewer (mandatory review of every change, read-only), spec-guardian (checks the implementation against the assignment's requirements when closing a task).

The cycle for every feature: a task statement with done criteria -> backend/frontend working in parallel against a contract I fixed up front -> tests -> review (critical findings send the task back) -> spec check -> `build + lint + test` -> my check on prod. The access-control core (`resolveAccess`, the ancestor chain built from the materialized path) was not delegated to subagents - the main agent wrote it directly, and I reviewed that code the most closely: a bug there is a data leak, not a UI glitch.

### Where the agent got it wrong

The grossest one - lists without pagination: by default the agent pulled a whole level or hierarchy in one query, and even once the keyset pattern already existed in the codebase, a new folder-picker endpoint again returned everything at once (`take: 1000`). I rejected that solution outright at review - it was redone as per-level loading with `hasChildren`, and I added a rule to the project: "every list endpoint is paginated; an unbounded `findMany` is a defect".

The rest caught at review:

- breadcrumbs returned the names of all ancestors - a viewer saw folder names above the share boundary (an information leak);
- the delete preview required the VIEWER level instead of OWNER;
- a cross-user cache leak: logout didn't clear the client cache, so a new user saw the previous user's folders; separately, a cache key without the room id mixed one's own room with someone else's shared room;
- the public "view" endpoint forced a download instead of inline PDF display from its very first implementation;
- after the move to infinite scroll, the share dialog only saw the first page - the public link "got lost" and creating a new one became a silent no-op; it took a second review pass to close this fully;
- a race at registration returned 500 instead of 409, and creating the user together with their room wasn't a single transaction;
- upload retry created a new intent - the file got duplicated as "name (1).pdf"; the upload panel's close button disappeared after the first error;
- deleting a folder never cleaned up storage: the service computed the list of keys, the controller discarded it;
- download opened via `window.open` with no file name (a UUID instead of the name, at risk of popup blocking);
- empty folder names passed validation (trim only on the frontend); backend validation messages weren't shown (an array instead of a string); there was no SPA fallback - F5 on prod would have given a 404;
- the Download button inside a clickable row fired together with the row navigation; the keyboard variant of this bug slipped past me and two review rounds;
- a subagent assigned only to `apps/api` edited a file in `apps/web` along the way; another time the agent rewrote a file from a stale copy in its context and wiped my parallel edit;
- a background dev server was left holding port 3000 after a task (EADDRINUSE).

It's because of mistakes of this kind that I kept review mandatory for every change, including the "simple" ones, and ran the final pass over all scenarios on prod by hand.
